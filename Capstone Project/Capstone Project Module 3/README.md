# Capstone Project Module 3

Capstone Project Module 3 is a project from Purwadhika to assess participants' understanding of the materials in Module 3 about Machine Learning

## Module 3 Materials That Used In This Project
- Classification
- Generalization, Underfitting, Overfitting
- Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
- Model Evaluation

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create classification model machine learning to predict customer churn from the dataset

## Business Problem for this project
E-commerce companies have a fairly high possibility of losing customers (customer churn). If not addressed, this can lead to financial losses, increased new customer acquisition costs, and decreased customer loyalty

## Who Is Having The Problem?
1. Marketing Team
- Promotional campaigns are not well-targeted, leading to discounts or retention campaigns being offered to loyal customers instead of those at risk of churning

2. Customer Support Team
- Unable to act proactively because they often only realize a customer has churned after they have already left

3. Product Manager
- Develops new features without clear data, potentially wasting resources on features that do not address customer needs

## Why Is It Important to Solve The Problem?
- The Marketing Team can create more targeted promotions, making marketing budgets more efficient and effective
- The Customer Support Team can identify potential churn customers earlier, allowing them to engage with them proactively and gather valuable feedback
- The Product Manager can develop more relevant features that help reduce customer churn
- Feedback collected by the Customer Support Team can provide valuable insights for the Product Manager to enhance the product

## What is The Goal of The Problem Solving?
- Reduce customer churn rate
- Develop a churn prediction model using machine learning to identify potential churn customers earlier
- Improve budget efficiency and effective budget allocation
- Increase company profitability

## What are the steps (overview) for me to Create Classification Model Machine Learning?
1. Import the data with Pandas
2. Try to understand the data by looking what are the columns and data type for every columns
4. Check N/A value (if any)
5. Do Feature Selection with Correlation Matrix
6. Check if there is/are outlier data(s)
7. Visualize the data from dataset to do the data analysis
8. Create Classification Model Machine Learning
9. Do Hyperparameter Tuning and Benchmark
