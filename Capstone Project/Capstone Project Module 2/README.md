In this project i need to do Data Analysis for dataset: **SaaS Sales**

## What is SaaS Sales?
SaaS Sales is a dataset that contains Sales data from a SaaS company

## What is my assignment?
My Assignment is, I'm a Data Analyst in the SaaS Company that will give some insight that can improve the business to be more beneficial

## What are the steps (overview) for me to do the analysis?
1. Import the data with Pandas
2. Try to understand the data by looking what are the columns and data type for every columns
3. Change data type to the correct one (if any)
4. Check N/A value (if any)
5. Check if there is/are outlier data(s)
6. Do visualization from the SaaS Sales Dataset
7. Create Dashboard in Tableu, **Here is the link:** https://public.tableau.com/shared/NH3M86DG2?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

**NB:** Actually, there are some outliers in SaaS Sales dataset and i already tried to seperate the outlier. But when i did more deeper Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and did some research, outlier data can be important in Sales, because with outlier data you can find something insightful and do more deeper analysis.
Because of that, i did **not** separate the outlier data and do the analysis with outlier data

**Here is the code when i separate the outlier data:**
