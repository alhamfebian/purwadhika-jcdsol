## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the SaaS Sales dataset and provide insights that can help improve the SaaS business, focusing on factors that influence profit and sales

## What is SaaS Sales?
SaaS Sales is a dataset that contains Sales data from a SaaS company

## What is my assignment?
As a Data Analyst at the SaaS company, I am tasked with providing insights to make the business more profitable

## What are the steps (overview) for me to do the analysis?
1. Import the data with Pandas
2. Try to understand the data by looking what are the columns and data type for every columns
3. Change data type to the correct one (if any)
4. Check N/A value (if any)
5. Check if there is/are outlier data(s)
6. Visualize the data from the SaaS Sales dataset
7. Create Dashboard in Tableu

## Note on Outliers
After performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) adn did some research, outlier data can be important in Sales data. With outlier data we can find something insightful and do more deeper analysis.
Because of that, i did **not** separate the outlier data and do the analysis with outlier data

**Here is the code when i separate the outlier data (after visualization Effect of Discount on Total Profit):**

## Insights from the Dashboard
- **Total Profit and Total Sales:** The dashboard highlights the overall total profit and total sales, allowing us to identify which products or country contribute the most to the company's revenue
- **Effect of Discount on Total Profit:** The dashboard shows how discounts affect overall profit, helping the company evaluate its discount strategies
- **Sales and Profit Distribution:** Visualize sales and profit distribution by Map to easier to see which country has high or low sales or profit
